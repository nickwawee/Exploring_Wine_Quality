# Exploring Wine Quality
This repo contains EDA of red and white wine and how it relates to quality. It makes use of the wine quality dataset publicly [available](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). It contains a code and a presentation that explores distributions, symmetry, power transformations, correlations, and multiple linear regression.
